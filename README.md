## About

Fuji is a free, open-source program for performing forensic acquisition of Mac
computers. It should work on any modern Intel or Apple Silicon device, as it
leverages standard executables provided by macOS.

Fuji performs a so-called *live acquisition* (the computer must be turned on) of
*logical* nature, i.e. it includes only existing files. The tool generates a DMG
file that can be imported in several digital forensics programs.

It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (version 3).
